### Abstract

This study introduces the multilayer modular fusion graph attention network (MMF-GAT), an interpretable predictive framework that combines principles from network science and sociology to forecast infection risk. The model is based on the premise that infection risk is influenced by an individual’s overlapping membership across various social groups and their participation in shared activities that function as inter¬action hubs. To represent this complex social fabric, the framework formalizes a mul¬tilayer social graph that is assumed to be composed of personal contact, household, and community layers via fourth-order tensor formalism. The MMF-GAT architecture employs layer-specific graph attention network (GAT) modules to preserve context-specific modularity, combined with a late-fusion mechanism that represents how individuals connect different social settings. This approach operationalizes key socio¬logical concepts by processing each layer independently before integration. When applied to a COVID-19 surveillance dataset of 2,264 individuals from Houston, Texas, the MMF-GAT model significantly outperformed five baseline models, achieving an accuracy of 0.78, an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90, an F1 score of 0.72, and a precision‒recall area under the curve (PRAUC) of 0.89. Explainable AI (XAI) analysis identified structural features, particularly household degree, degree of personal con¬tact, and affiliation with educational centers, as the most influential predictors. Owing to its robust predictive accuracy, the model effectively identifies high-risk individuals and settings, positioning it as a valuable tool for public health operations. This study makes a dual contribution. First, it advances multilayer network science through a novel computational architecture that preserves modularity. Second, it provides a validated, high-performance tool for public health informatics. This computational tool can support targeted interventions by optimizing contact tracing prioritization and resource allocation.

### Author Summary

We developed a new AI approach to predicting and interpreting infection risk during disease outbreaks by examining how individuals’ daily social environ¬ments overlap, including personal contacts, households, and community spac¬es such as schools and workplaces. Unlike traditional models that treat these interactions as a simple whole, our method preserves unique structure of each social layer before integrating them. This layered approach allows us to capture the complexity of how infections spread in real life. Our model was tested on public health surveillance data from COVID-19 outbreak in Houston, Texas, U.S., and was found to predict infection risk with high accuracy, outperforming existing methods. The key factors influencing risk included the size of households, the number of close contacts, and affiliation with education settings. Our findings demonstrate how infections propagate through both tight-knit groups and the key bridging roles of individuals who connect multiple social circles. This understand¬ing offers public health officials a powerful tool to target interventions effectively, enabling effective allocation of limited resources for testing and contact tracing, consequently improving outbreak control and reducing avoidable disruption.
